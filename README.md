# Intoduction
NOTE: Work in progress, project isn't complete yet but you are welcome to have a look on how it is going so far.
This is a Project for my C++ for Game Development course. Classic Snake Game that we all are familiar with (using SFML Library).
Just open Game.sln and enjoy.

# Repository content
## SFMLTemplate
This is simple template project for developing games with SFML library.
Just open the Game.sln, compile and run project named Game. If you want to create a game - copy it, renaming it's directory and files SFMLTemplate.vcxproj and SFMLTemplate.vcxproj.filters.
Then add new project to Game.sln via visual studio.

## SFML
This directory contains the entire compiled SFML library for simplifying things. There is SFML VS project to maka easy access to SFML headers inside IDE.
